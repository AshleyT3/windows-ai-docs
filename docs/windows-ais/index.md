# Windows AI Studio


## Coming soon

Windows AI Studio simplifies generative AI app development by bringing together cutting-edge AI development tools and models from [Azure AI Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-studio) and other catalogs such as [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co).

Windows AI Studio enables developers to fine-tune, customize and deploy state-of-the-art small language models, or SLMs, for local use in their Windows apps. It provides an end-to-end guided workspace setup that includes model configuration UI and guided walkthroughs to fine-tune popular SLMs â€“ like Phi, and state of the art models such as [Llama 2](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/11/15/announcing-preview-support-for-llama-2-in-directml/) and Mistral. 

Developers can rapidly test their fine-tuned model using the Prompt Flow and Gradio templates integrated into the workspace.
